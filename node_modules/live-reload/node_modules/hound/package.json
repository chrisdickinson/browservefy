There are no runtime\ndependencies outside of the standard node.js libraries.  There is a development\ndependency on [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/), which is required\nto run the tests.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install hound\n```\n\nBecause hound has no runtime dependencies, it is also possible to download the\nlibrary manually and require it directly.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n```javascript\nhound = require('hound')\n\n// Create a directory tree watcher.\nwatcher = hound.watch('/tmp')\n\n// Create a file watcher.\nwatcher = hound.watch('/tmp/file.txt')\n\n// Add callbacks for file and directory events.  The change event only applies\n// to files.\nwatcher.on('create', function(file, stats) {\n  console.log(file + ' was created')\n})\nwatcher.on('change', function(file, stats) {\n  console.log(file + ' was changed')\n})\nwatcher.on('delete', function(file) {\n  console.log(file + ' was deleted')\n})\n\n// Unwatch specific files or directories.\nwatcher.unwatch('/tmp/another_file')\n\n// Unwatch all watched files and directories.\nwatcher.clear()\n```\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTo run the tests using your global Jasmine binary:\n\n```\njasmine-node spec\n```\n\nTo run the tests using your local Jasmine binary in node_modules:\n\n```\nnode_modules/.bin/jasmine-node spec\n```\n\nThe tests work on actual directory trees that are generated in the tmp\ndirectory.\n",
